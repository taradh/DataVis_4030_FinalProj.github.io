        <h4><strong>The Diversity Conversation Today</strong></h4>
        <p>
        In the aftermath of the murders of 
        <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/09/breonna-taylor-louisville-shooting-police-what-we-know.html">Breonna Taylor</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/mcmichaels-hearing-ahmaud-arbery/index.html">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html">George Floyd</a>, and 
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database">countless others</a>, 
        the United States has been forced to reckon with the long history of prejudice and discrimination which 
        is tightly woven into its institutions. Many companies have issued statements speaking out against racism, 
        “standing” in solidarity with the larger 
        <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/">#BlackLivesMatter</a> 
        movement urging for justice. Even big tech, as documented by 
        <a href="https://tpinsights.com/2020/05/31/twilio-box-spotify-and-other-tech-ceos-speak-out-against-racism-and-police-brutality-others-stay-silent/">The Plug</a>, 
        spoke out, including the likes of Apple, Google, and Facebook.
        
        <br><br>
        
        In tandem with larger conversations about race in the United States, there has been a resurgence in the discussion of
        diversity and inclusion and its benefits in the workplace. In a 
        <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">2020 report</a> 
        by management consultancy, McKinsey & Company, among 1,000 public companies across North and Latin America and the United Kingdom, 
        those companies who had greater ethnic and cultural diversity within their executive leadership saw <strong>36 percent more in profits</strong> than 
        those without such diversity. In a 
        <a href="https://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/Innovation_Through_Diversity.pdf">report conducted by Forbes</a>, 
        they find, through surveys and interviews of 321 diversity and inclusion executives across 
        the globe, that many recognize that diversity is "<strong>crucial</strong> to encouraging different perspectives and ideas that foster innovation”. 
        The <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation">Harvard Business Review reported</a> 
        that companies who have diverse talent are <strong>70 percent more likely to tap into a new market</strong>, as “inherently diverse contributors 
        understand the unmet needs of under-leveraged markets”.

        <h4><strong>The Numbers</strong></h4>
        <p>
        As big tech has largely assisted with the documentation of police brutality and social justice movements, through viral iPhone footage, trending 
        Twitter hashtags, and top Google searches, we seek to investigate the extent to which big tech’s solidarity statements are reflective of their 
        workforce. We examine Apple, Google, and Facebook’s diversity reports, recording the makeup of their workforce by gender and race from 2014 to 2018.

        <h4><strong>Actions—Past, Present and Future—Speak Louder Than Words</strong></h4>
        <p>
        Given the current cultural climate and data endorsing the benefits of diversity in the workplace, the time is now for big tech, and other companies, 
        to examine their current standing, recognize their shortfalls and develop <strong>real, effective solutions</strong> to the lack of representation within their companies.
